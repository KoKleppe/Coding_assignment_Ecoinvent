# Project Title

This repository contains some scripts I wrote to parse XML data and convert them into them into diagrams. 

## Getting Started
Put the three files in a directory and create a subdirectory called data within that directory then simply run plot_bar.py from the terminal.

```
  python3 plot_bar.py
```
